"""
A Python script that uses Demucs to separate audio files into stems.

This script:
- Prompts the user for a folder containing audio files.
- Searches the folder for audio files (e.g. .wav, .mp3, .flac, .ogg, .opus, .m4a).
- Asks the user how they want to split the audio:
    Option 1: Default 4 stems (drums, bass, vocals, other)
    Option 2: 2 stems (typically vocals and accompaniment)
- Calls Demucs with the chosen parameters.
- Outputs the separated stems in the same folder (using Demucsâ€™s --out argument).
